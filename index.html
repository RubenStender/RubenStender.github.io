                <p class="Blink fs-7 pb-5">Welcome to my portfolio</p>
                <p class="Blink fs-7 pb-5">I'm a 18 year old beginner software developer from Enschede, a city in the netherlands.
                I like creating stories, games and build universes of characters.
                My creativity constantly gives me ideas for new characters, abilities, and places for my worldbuilding project.
                And it's giving me new ideas for games.</p>
                <h2 class="Blink fs-5">The beginning</h2>
                <p class="Blink fs-7 pb-5">My interest in code and worldbuilding comes from a young age for me.
                When i played my first couple of games on my first console, the Xbox-360. I loved the way games felt.
                How the story behind it was, how the characters looked and how the emotions changed by all of them.
                When i started get into super hero movies i knew i wanted to create characters aswell.
                The first couple of characters i created were harsh. Not fully thought out and just overall not the best.
                And i missed the way the game characters felt alive and mine felt... bland.
                Since then i wanted to go into either animation or game development.
                </p>
                <h2 class="Blink fs-5">Where am i at now?</h2>
                <p class="Blink fs-7 pb-5">I'm in the start of my second year in software development now.
