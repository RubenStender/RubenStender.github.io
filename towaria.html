                <p class="Blink fs-7 pb-5">Ever had a moment where time goes slow and your train arrives later? Not anymore!!!
                    Introducing... TOWARIA!!!
                </p>
                <h2 class="Blink fs-5">What is towaria?</h2>
                <p class="Blink fs-7 pb-5">Towaria is a tower defense game with a medieval type theme.
                The game is made to be a cute game, targeted to children or just people that like to kill time.
                The game has a blocky voxel artstyle, letting it feed more in the cute vibe of the game.
                The game plays like just a normal tower defense but we made it more accesible to people that don't have a lot of time on their hands.
                This game is a fast-paced level based tower defense.
                Do you fail the round get another chance untill you do get it. Get coins from enemies and go to the next stage.
                </p>
                <h2 class="Blink fs-5">Some mechanics</h2>
                <p class="Blink">It plays like a normal tower defense but with a twist.
                If you fail a stage you restart the same wave with the same towers you previously placed.
                After every wave you have the ability to place more towers.
                Every tower does different damage.
                </p>
                <h2 class="Blink">The four towers:</h2>
                <ol class="Blink pb-5">
                    <li>Archer tower</li>
                    <li>Cannon tower</li>
                    <li>Magic tower</li>
                    <li>Shock tower</li>
                </ol>
                <p class="Blink">These towers work as followed!!!</p>
                <h3 class="Blink">Archer tower</h3>
                <p class="Blink">The archer tower is a tower with a quite fast fire rate but not a lot of damage.
                 The tower shoots small arrows to defeat the enemy
                </p>
                <h3 class="Blink">The cannon tower</h3>
                <p class="Blink">The cannon tower is a slow but heavy damage tower. It takes down strong foes with
                an area of damage but shoots with a slower firerate then other towers. Great for slow enemies.
                </p>
                <h3 class="Blink">The magic tower</h3>
                <p class="Blink">An medium damage and quite fast tower. The magic tower shoots bursts of magic energy to the enemies.
                It fires as fast as the archer tower but does more damage then the archer tower.This however does
                not make the archer tower useless. This tower might be stronger but it is also way pricier. 
                </p>
                <h3 class="Blink">Shockwave tower</h3>
                <p class="Blink">The shockwave tower is an extremely slow tower that does minimal damage. This tower stuns enemies in it's
                range, making them completely unable to move for a couple of seconds. This gives you more time to damage the enemies.      
                </p>
